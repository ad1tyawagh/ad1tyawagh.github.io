# **Introduction to $$\LaTeX$$**
---  
### What is $$\LaTeX$$ ?

`LaTeX` is a document preparing system for high quality typesetting. It is used for Articles, Presentations, Books, Reports, Research papers scientific and technical documents, law-texts, scorecards bills, letters and a lot of other things!

It is best used for uniform formatting of the documents. All we have to worry about is the content, the formatting is taken care by $$\LaTeX$$

# **Creating documents in $\LaTeX$**
---  

For creating  documents, we need a $$\TeX$$ Distribution and a text editor. There are a variety of $$\TeX$$ distributions that are available both offline and online. According to your preference you can use any one of them. I have linked a few of them below.

- Linux  
Check your Linux distributions software source for a TeX distribution including LaTeX. You can also install the current [TeX Live distribution](https://www.tug.org/texlive) directly -- in fact this may be advisable as many Linux distributions only contain older versions of TeX Live, see [Linux TeX Live package status](https://repology.org/metapackage/texlive/versions) for details.

- Mac OS  
The [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) distribution contains everything you need, including a complete TeX system with LaTeX itself and editors to write documents.

- Windows  
Check out the [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) or [proTeXt](http://www.tug.org/protext/) or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive)distributions; they contain a complete TeX system with LaTeX itself and editors to write documents.

- Online  
LaTeX online services like [Papeeria](http://papeeria.com/), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/), [Datazar](https://www.datazar.com/), and [LaTeX base](https://latexbase.com/) offer the ability to edit, view and download LaTeX files and resulting PDFs.
