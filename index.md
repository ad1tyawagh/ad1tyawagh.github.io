 I am Aditya Wagh, and a graduate of Birla Institute Of Technology & Sciences, Pilani (BITS Pilani).<br><br> My research interests are somewhere between computer vision, robotics and embedded systems. I also have a newfound interest in Human-Computer Interaction.

I maintain a list of my projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="https://github.com/ad1tyawagh">Github profile.</a><br><br>
