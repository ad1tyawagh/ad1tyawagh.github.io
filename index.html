Hello! I am Aditya. I am an engineer, and I got my B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from
Birla Institute Of Technology & Sciences,
Pilani - <b>BITS Pilani</b> in 2019. I had a chance to work at the
<a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/departments/cyber-physical-systems/integrated-systems/">Integrated Systems
    Lab</a>
at CSIR - Central Electronics Engineering Institute, Pilani under the guidance
of <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sumeet-saurav/">Mr. Sumeet Saurav</a>
during my final year of undergraduate studies.<br>
<br>My <b>interests</b> lie at the intersection of <b>machine learning, computer vision, control

<br><br> When I am not working, I spend my time watching science fiction movies
and TV shows, and often play multiplayer video games.
I have a strong curiosity to know the reason behind things, about how they are done, and why they are done
they way they are. It makes me restless when I don't get the answer to those questions!<br>
<br>I <b>blog</b> about things that I come across and find fascinating, which is <u><a href="/blog">here</a></u>
