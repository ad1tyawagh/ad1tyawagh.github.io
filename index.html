        <p class="my-name"><b>Aditya</b> Wagh</p>
    <p>Hello there! Yes you! I am Aditya. I am an engineer, and I did my B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from Birla Institute Of Technology & Sciences,
    Pilani (BITS Pilani) from 2015-2019. I had a chance to work at the
    <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/departments/cyber-physical-systems/integrated-systems/">Integrated Systems Lab</a>
    at CSIR - Central Electronics Engineering Institute, Pilani under the guidance
    of <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sumeet-saurav/">Mr. Sumeet Saurav</a>
    during my final year of undergraduate studies.</p>
    <p>My interests are at the intersection of computer vision, control
    systems, robotics and embedded systems. I am particularly interested in
    developing intelligent autonomous systems for environmental and social problems.</p>

    <p>I maintain a list of my projects under the
    <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/ad1tyawagh">Github profile.</a>To get a better insight on my life as an academic so far, you can have a look
        at my <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ad1tyawagh/resume/blob/master/aditya_resume.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>.

    <p> When I am not doing anything "<b>supposedly academic</b>", I spend my time watching science fiction movies and TV shows, and often play multiplayer video games. 
        I have a strong curiosity to know the reason behind things, about how they are done, and why they are done they way they are. It makes me restless when I don't get the answer to those questions! 
    <p>I blog about things that I come across and find fascinating, which is <a href="/blog">here</a>.</p>
