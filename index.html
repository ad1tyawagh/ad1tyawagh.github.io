        Hello! I am Aditya. I am an engineer, and I got my B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from
        Birla Institute Of Technology & Sciences,
        Pilani <b>(BITS Pilani)</b> in 2019. I had a chance to work at the
        <u><a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/departments/cyber-physical-systems/integrated-systems/">Integrated Systems
            Lab</a></u>
        at CSIR - Central Electronics Engineering Institute, Pilani under the guidance
        of <u><a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sumeet-saurav/">Mr. Sumeet Saurav</a></u>
        during my final year of undergraduate studies.<br>
        <br><b>My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, control
        systems, and embedded systems.</b> I am particularly interested in
        developing intelligent autonomous systems for environmental and social problems. To get a better insight on my life as an academic so
        far, you can have a look
        at my <a href="https://www.adityawagh.ml/cv.html"><u>curriculum
            vitae.</a></u><br>

        <br> When I am not working, I spend my time watching science fiction movies
        and TV shows, and often play multiplayer video games.
        I have a strong curiosity to know the reason behind things, about how they are done, and why they are done
        they way they are. It makes me restless when I don't get the answer to those questions!<br>
        <br>I <b>blog</b> about things that I come across and find fascinating, which is <u><a href="/blog">here</a></u>
