    <p >Hello! I am Aditya. I am an engineer, and I did my B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from
        Birla Institute Of Technology & Sciences,
        Pilani (BITS Pilani) from 2015-2019. I had a chance to work at the
        <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/departments/cyber-physical-systems/integrated-systems/">Integrated Systems
            Lab</a>
        at CSIR - Central Electronics Engineering Institute, Pilani under the guidance
        of <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sumeet-saurav/">Mr. Sumeet Saurav</a>
        during my final year of undergraduate studies.<br>
        <br>My interests are at the intersection of computer vision, control
        systems, and embedded systems. I am particularly interested in
        developing intelligent autonomous systems for environmental and social problems. To get a better insight on my life as an academic so
        far, you can have a look
        at my <a href="https://www.adityawagh.ml/cv.html">curriculum
            vitae</a>.<br>

        <br> When I am not doing anything "<b>supposedly academic</b>", I spend my time watching science fiction movies
        and TV shows, and often play multiplayer video games.
        I have a strong curiosity to know the reason behind things, about how they are done, and why they are done
        they way they are. It makes me restless when I don't get the answer to those questions!<br>
        <br>I blog about things that I come across and find fascinating, which is <a href="/blog">here</a>.
