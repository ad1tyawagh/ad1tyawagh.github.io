  align="right" %} I am a graduate of Birla Institute Of Technology & Sciences,
    Pilani (BITS Pilani).<br /><br />
    My research interests are at the intersection of computer vision, control
    systems, robotics and embedded systems. I am particularly interested in
    developing autonomous systems for tedious physical tasks. <br /><br />
    I had a chance to work on at the
    <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/departments/cyber-physical-systems/integrated-systems/">Integrated Systems Lab</a>
    at CSIR - Central Electronics Engineering Institute, Pilani under the guidance
    of
    <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sumeet-saurav/">
        Mr. Sumeet Saurav
    </a>
    during my final year at BITS Pilani.<br /><br />

    I maintain a list of my projects under the
    <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/ad1tyawagh">Github profile.</a>
